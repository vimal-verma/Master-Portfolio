# Master-Portfolio
- A clean, beautiful, responsive and 100% customizable portfolio template for Developers!
- The website is completely built on `react-js` framework of `javascript`🔥.
- In this project, there are basically Personal Information that you need to change to customize this to anyone else's portfolio: 
- You will find `src/Name.js` file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:
-
    ``` 
    const greeting = {
        title: "Your Name",
        logo_name: "Name",
        subTitle:
        "subTitle.",
    };
    const socialMedia = {
        facebook: "Your facebook link",
        twitter: "Your twitter link",
        instagram: "Your instagram link",
        github: "Your github link",
        gitlab: "Your gitlab link",
        devto: "Your devto link",
        mailto: "mailto:Your mail"
    };
    const About = {
        School: "Your School Name",
        College: "Your College Name",
        university: "Your university Name",
        Home: "Your Home city"
    };
    ```
